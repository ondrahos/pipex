## Pipex Project Summary

### Project Overview

The pipex project at 42 School is designed to introduce students to Unix system calls and processes. It involves creating a program that mimics the functionality of the shell's pipe operator, allowing the redirection of input and output streams between multiple processes.

### Key Objectives

- Gain a deep understanding of Unix system calls and process management.
- Implement the basic functionalities of shell pipes, including file input/output redirection and process execution.
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully to ensure robustness and reliability.

### Core Features

1. **Command Execution:**
   - Execute commands provided as arguments to the pipex program.

2. **Input and Output Redirection:**
   - Redirect standard input/output streams to and from files specified by the user.

3. **Pipe Creation:**
   - Create pipes to establish communication channels between processes.

4. **Process Management:**
   - Manage child processes efficiently, handling their creation, execution, and termination.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Detect and handle errors effectively, providing informative error messages to the user.

### Benefits

- Deepens understanding of Unix system programming concepts.
- Improves proficiency in C programming language.
- Provides practical experience in process management and inter-process communication.

### Conclusion

The pipex project is an excellent opportunity for students to delve into Unix system programming and gain hands-on experience with processes, pipes, and file operations. By completing this project, students develop essential skills that are crucial for building robust and efficient software systems in Unix-like environments.
